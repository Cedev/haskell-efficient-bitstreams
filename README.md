# Efficient Bitstreams in Haskell

See the corresponding [SO question](https://github.com/mcmayer/haskell-efficient-bitstreams).



## `length`

Stream bytes and count. Source files `length.c` and `Length.hs`.

## `sum-bytes`

Stream bytes and add them up. Source files `sum-bytes.c` and `SumBytes.hs`.

## `longest-seq`

Stream bytes and find the longest sequence of identical bits. Source files `longest-seq.c` and `LongestSeq.hs`.
